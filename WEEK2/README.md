## Week2
## Assignment1

A c program that takes two integer values, first prints the values of these variables. Then a function called swap1 is created which takes two integers and swaps their values.

## How swap1 function works

It uses new variable called temp to copy one of the values and assign it to another. After swapping function prints out the variables with new values.

```bash
int temp = val1;
val1 = val2;
val2 = temp;
```

## How to run
```bash
$ gcc first.c -o first
$ ./first
```
