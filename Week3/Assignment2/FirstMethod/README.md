## First Method

In this method, only char arrays with the same lengths can be swapped. It uses function called swapStrings to swap values.

## How swapStrings function works

It uses third user defined integer called temp to copy content of one char array inside a loop swapping them with the content of the other array.

```bash
char temp;

//inside a loop
temp = destination[i];
destination[i] = source[i];
source[i] = temp;

```
